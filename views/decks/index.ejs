        <h4>About this App</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>The idea for Exp Cards came from a love of card games like Dominion and Magic The Gathering, mixed with a desire to create a more fun way for people to share there experiences with others. In the future there will be a game mode for Exp Cards that will involve players matching certain aspects of eachothers cards. This will allow people to share there experiences and hear about relavant experiences from their friends. I hope this simple idea can spark the spirit commonality between friends and even strangers. </p>
